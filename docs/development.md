# Development Guide

## Git Hooks Setup

This project includes git hooks to maintain code quality standards. The hooks are stored in the `hooks/` directory and can be shared across the team.

## Setup

After cloning the repository, configure git to use the hooks directory:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath hooks
```

That's it! Git will automatically run hooks from the `hooks/` directory from now on.

## Pre-commit Hook

The `hooks/pre-commit` hook automatically runs `cargo clippy` before each commit. If clippy finds any warnings or errors, the commit will be prevented until they are fixed.

### Features

- ✅ Runs clippy with `-D warnings` to treat all warnings as errors
- ✅ Prevents commits that fail clippy checks
- ✅ Clear error messages guide developers on how to fix issues
- ✅ Stored in version control and shared with the team
- ✅ No installation script needed - git handles it automatically via `core.hooksPath`

### Manual Checks

You can also manually run clippy at any time:

```bash
# Check for clippy issues
cargo clippy --all-targets

# Fix clippy issues with automatic suggestions
cargo clippy --all-targets --fix
```
